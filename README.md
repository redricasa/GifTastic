Gif genarator through Giphy API
## LINK TO DEPLOYED TECHNOLOGY: https://redricasa.github.io/GifTastic/
## Overview
- We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.
- When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
## TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Jquery
- CSS
- Javascript
- ajax
- Giphy API
## Next Steps
- Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
- Add bootstrap to make the CSS more appealing. 
- Add margins between the gifs.
